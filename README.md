# tsuchiba-radio
An internet application to emulate the experience of your FM radio tuning and out of stations as you drive cross-country.

Run `npm start` to open up a little express server to run the application at `localhost:3000` and run `npm run build` to build the React application.

There are a few missing files that are used to generate and audit the stations list that will be added eventually. But the stations list included in the `public` folder is all the application needs.
